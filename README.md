# hello-world

 my name is Peter, and I enjoy seeking challenges working in the realms of web development, especially React, NextJs, and TypeScript, microservice architectures, GraphQL, containerization, and cloud technologies. 
 
 Continuously working on gaining a more in depth knowledge, due to the fact that my skill set range is rather wide than deep when it comes to experience with different stacks. I consider myself very adaptive to the actual project context I get involved with and in-depth knowledge takes a little bit of ramp up, although I enjoy experiencing different technologies. 
 
 Regardless of technology stack I am a pupil of the mastery of web development, and team management. I am flexible and open to take on any challenge when it comes to it, improving every day to build better digital solutions to human problems.
